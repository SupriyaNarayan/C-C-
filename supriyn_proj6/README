Project description:
The sleepingPanda Game.
Panda flying on magic carpet in a background from Kung fu panda movie. 
The controls ASDW are implemented, where the panda shall change its path on the same ground in y direction when s and w keys are used. The keys a and d help panda move left and right respectively.
Painters algorithm is implemented to blades which needs to be shot by the panda.
key 'h' is used to shoot panda bullet to destroy blades. 
key 'r' handels the reset function.
key 'g' for godmode and the healthbar is not affected when godmode is on.
Hud is displayed for 3 seconds in the beginning and later can be toggled using the key 'F1'.
The panda is restricted with boundary to move using the keys, it shall not move outside the world.
There is a health hud which is decremented based on time and final score of number of blades destroyed shall be displayed and MagicPanda disappears.
The blades explode and reappear after chunk explosion.
The bullet from panda is objectpooled.
Each time blade is destroyed by panda bullet or by panda itself, 1 point is increased in score and the blade reappears as a smart sprite with AI where the blades try to escape from panda and not panda bullets.
There is a backgroud music taken from kungfupanda movie. And each time a bullet is shot (i.e is key h is pressed) a sound is itegrated too.
